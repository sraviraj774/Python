print("Python Introduction")

# Python was released in 1991 and Java in 1995.
# Python is simple and powerful language has wide use - Desktop app, Web app, Game Dev., Machine learning,IOT.
# We do not have to mention the type of value that a variable contain in python.
# Python is slower than Java.

# Python programs are portable or platform Independent.
# Platform : It is a combination of operating system and architecture. For example : OS - Windows and Archi. - Intel.
# Programs are typically first compiled into an intermediate code, then the code is run by the interpreter.

# Python Program ( .py) --- compiler --> Byte code (.pyc) ---Interpreter (PVM - Python Virtual Machine) --> Binary code.
# This Byte Code is used in different platform to execute our python code. This make python code platform independent.
# C and C++ are not platform independent.

# Popular Applications Built in python - YouTube, DropBox, Reddit, Quora, Instagram, Mozilla Firefox, Netflix.

# To Run Python Program on Command Line - python name.py

# Python in Data Science -

# Python is used in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision.
# Python Libraries for Data Science - Python's strength in data science comes from its powerful libraries.

# Random: For generating random test cases while training and testing of data.
# NumPy: For numerical operations and working with arrays.
# Pandas: Ideal for data manipulation and analysis.
# Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
# Scikit-Learn: Essential for machine learning tasks.
